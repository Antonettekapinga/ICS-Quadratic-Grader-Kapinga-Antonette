## 📖 Overview

This project is a **single-page web application** developed as part of the ICT251 JavaScript and GitHub Activity.  
It demonstrates how to use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create an **interactive calculator** and **grading tool**.  

The app performs two main functions:
1. **Quadratic Equation Solver** – Solves quadratic equations of the form *ax² + bx + c = 0* and displays the discriminant, nature of roots, and the actual roots (real or complex).  
2. **Grading System** – Converts a numeric score (0–100) into a letter grade (A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, or D).

## ⚙️ Features

### Quadratic Solver
- Accepts user input for coefficients **a**, **b**, and **c**.  
- Validates inputs (e.g., ensures `a ≠ 0` and all values are numbers).  
- Calculates and displays:
  - The **discriminant (D = b² - 4ac)**
  - The **nature of roots** (real, repeated, or complex)
  - The **roots** of the equation.

### Grading System
- Accepts a numeric score between **0 and 100**.  
- Validates for missing, invalid, or out-of-range inputs.  
- Displays the corresponding **letter grade** based on this scale:

| Score Range | Grade |
|--------------|--------|
| 85–100 | A+ |
| 75–84 | A |
| 65–74 | B+ |
| 60–64 | B |
| 55–59 | C+ |
| 50–54 | C |
| 0–49 | D |
